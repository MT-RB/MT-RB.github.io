  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how a computer uses binary to form an image, and how to code a picture of a space invader alien. An effective strategy was to have my partner read off what I had to type whilst I was coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For a significant part of the lesson I didn't have a partner, which was both inconvenient and harder, as I was constantly looking away from the book, losing my place and having to re - find where it was that I had left off.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will work on keeping track of where I am in the book and reading the side text to give me a better understanding of what I am coding.</td>
