		     **I.T HOMEWORK**

In this week's lesson we started off the lesson by watching the 'sorting hat’ scene from Harry Potter. After watching the video we were given the instruction : ‘Go onto Google Classroom and click on the link, you will be taken to a Google Docs document, from there you will find more instructions.’ The link took us to a page that we used to make our own ‘sorting hat’ (using Microsoft Block Editor)that picked between Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff on micro:bit.

After completing this task we then had to go back to the instruction sheet and fill in a form asking us what specific mechanics of the coding did, which only took about 3 mins. Finally we had to use Java Script to create another sorting hat, this time using the Houses: Foxell, Holman, Newman, Pearson, Rayner and Thorne, which was very hard!
