		          **I.T HOMEWORK**

In this week's lesson we started off the lesson by watching the advert / commercial for micro:bit, which is a project set up by the BBC to teach school children how to code. We then were told to go off on our own and literally just fiddle around with the coding software, you could choose to code with either: Java Script, Microsoft Block Editor or Microsoft Touch Develop (I used the Java Script, as I felt that it was most accessible). I’m not sure as to what other people created, but I worked out how to make the micro:bit display the word 'SALTY’ (my nickname) and then finish off with an M that fades out. 

Generally, after looking back over the lesson, I think that it is one of my favourites.
