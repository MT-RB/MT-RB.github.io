    <td>In this lesson I learnt how to program a computer to add and subtract a number of items, and recognise when there was nothing left to subtract and respond to this. An effective strategy for getting as much done as possible, was to read thoroughly through the steps before coding. Another good strategy was to think through the steps before performing them so you can work out any mistakes.</td>
