                    IT Homework

In this week's I.T lesson, we had a more relaxed lesson for the first week back. We started of the lesson by viewing who had completed the Easter homework and who hadn’t, and listening to their excuses as to why they hadn’t completed it, no of which were too far-fetched to imagine. We then looked at a few people’s Prezi presentations, and gave feedback on how they could improve, for example they should write less on each slide and just write small notes that are prompts or, don’t zoom in and out so far, etc, etc, etc. After looking at a few presentations, we realised that we could improve our work by being more to the point and more specific.

We then pier-marked each other's blog website and filled out a form to judge whether we thought that their blog was : My eyes hurt! Could be better, Good, Great or Awesome.
