    <td>I finished my work on functions (I was on 22%) and finished the final part of the activity right at the end of the lesson. I extended my knowledge of how arguments work and used them a lot, using the return feature a lot and having to add quite a few variables.</td>

    <td>I need to work on not getting ahead of myself so that I can significantly the chances of making a mistake, which can easily set me back quite a lot and mean that I have to go back and then be slow and methodical whilst going through the checking  process, which - if there is a lot of code - can be quite monotonous and can all be prevented if I simply check as I go through.</td>
