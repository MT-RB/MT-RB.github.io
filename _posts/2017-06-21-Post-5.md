**I.T Blog Post 5**

In today's lesson our normal teacher, wasn’t here so another I.T teacher (Mr.Keen), took our lesson instead. He started off by asking us to do something very simple : talk him through making a cup of tea. This sounds very simple, however it was a lot harder than it seems to talk through something so simple, as when you’re doing it your brain goes into a sort of 'autopilot’ so you aren’t really thinking about what you are doing because it is so mundane and not very memorable. We weren’t specific enough at first, however - with the help of Mr.Keen - we solved that very quickly and were then challenged to do another thing, describe how to make a cup of tea as if you were programming a robotic arm. This was hard to do but a very simple concept, make it as specific as possible so that there was nothing that could go wrong. After we had talked about this we advanced to a discussion about perspective, specifically the idea that there is no proof that one person is seeing the same colour as the person next to them, they are seeing different colours but simply assume that they are seeing the same colour because it has the same name. This lead to Mr.Keen bringing up ‘The Dress’ ( a dress that the internet went crazy over because of its odd way of appearing one colour to one person and another colour to someone else), which is what we finished the lesson on.
