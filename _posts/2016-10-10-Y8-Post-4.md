    <td>To code a program that asks a question and responds to the answer.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes I successfully coded a program that responds to the answers of specific questions.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that computers recognise capitalisation and you have to be very careful when you code to be as specific as possible when you are coding as the program will not work if you code it incorrectly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on being more specific when I'm coding, the programs will not run without me being as specific as possible. I also need to make sure to read the side notes as well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure to put capitals in the correct places, as variables and other parts of the program will completely stop working and destroy the rest of the code unless you make sure that it's 100% correct.</td>
