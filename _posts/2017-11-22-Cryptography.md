    <td>I simply listened to what Mr. Keen was saying about how to code the cypher, as well as using the template that was put up on the board, from then it was just simply using common sense to work out what you had to put into the vlookup to get the correct outcome. It was also useful to just sit back and take a second to compare my work to my peers to see what they had done differently to me and see if there was anything I could help them with or if they understood something better than me and could help me out.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>There wasn't much in this lesson that limited my learning however in general I just need to make sure to take things slowly, work methodically and I should start asking my peers to proof check my work as it will mean that I minimise mistakes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will begin asking my peers to proof check my work as well and going slowly with my work and making sure to continue to listen to Mr.Keen because he knows best and is the person who has set the work and therefore knows exactly what to do and the most effective / efficient way to do it.  </td>
