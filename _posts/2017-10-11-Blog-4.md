  <tr>
    <td>It was effective to just sit and think through all of the potential problems that a business could face, as well as working with my classmates and sharing ideas, this meant that we could think of a wider variety of potential challenges, etc.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Very little limited my learning, I just needed to not get too caught up on one type of idea. I also needed to be a little more realistic sometimes as I did get a little carried away at times.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will continue to work on helping people out and working through problems myself. I will also try and work hard towards not getting too caught up if something doesn't work, and try and improvise and adapt to difficult / annoying situations. I will try to stay positive when working.</td>
