                         			**BLOG POST**

In this week's lesson we worked on creating our own games using micro:bit (which is  a project set up by the BBC to teach school - children how to code). My game (and my partner’s) is called 'Laser Dodgers!’ And is a game based around the objective of well, dodging the ‘lasers’ that scroll across the screen. I learnt that you should set up all the variables BEFORE you start with your actual code, and I will make sure to do so next week.
