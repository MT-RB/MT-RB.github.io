			**I.T** **HOMEWORK**

 In the lesson we learnt about different forms of media, from social media (e.g instagram, facebook, etc.) to the news. There are many different types of media. We filled in a 'media literacy' bingo sheet, which, rather than having numbers, had different skills/ talents in each box, which we then had to ask other people in the class if they had. When Mr. Keen called us back to the front of the room we discussed which skills had been the least common in the class, for instance one of the questions was: can this person edit a video? Which only about five people could actually do. We also discussed how, in something so small as a class game of bingo (with no prizes), people had exaggerated to make themselves seem ‘cooler’ or feel less insecure, which then lead to us watching a short advert, that showed three hamsters going to the gym and getting fitter. This advert was saying how a car had been adapted and made better, but this advert showed how at first the hamsters were fat, which represented the car not being very good, and then the hamsters were slimmer and worthy of walking down the red carpet, which represented  the car being improved and better than ever. This advert then presented an opportunity to talk about how the social ‘norm’ is that fat= bad and slim and stylish= good and how it then means that people get judged - not based on their personality - but by their appearance, which is the **main **reason people feel insecure about themselves, which links in to my earlier point about how people exaggerated, in a silly game of bingo, so that they would feel socially secure.
