                           I.T HOMEWORK

In this week's IT lesson we learned about what to post and what not to post on social media. We started the lesson by coming to the front and talking about the advantages and disadvantages of social media, which gave us an idea of what we should be aware of/watch out for, here are some examples...

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Advantages </td>
    <td>Disadvantages</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Free (sort of).
You can send pictures/videos to your friends and family.
You can choose to have a private or open account.
</td>
    <td>You can be groomed/stalked without knowing.
People can troll you or send hate messages.
People can trick you and conceal their identity.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


 	Obviously there were a lot more examples, but those were some of the ones that were mentioned straight away. After this discussion we did a little activity to see what we thought was good or bad to post on social media, to do this activity we were given about twelve pieces of paper, which each had a different example of a post that someone had sent out, some were good and some were bad. What we had to actually do for the activity, was put the cards in order from harmless to most harmful (or offensive) and quite surprisingly, there was a lot of variation in what people thought was worst and what was the most harmless.

	We then came back to the front of the classroom and talked about what some of the boundaries for what we posted should be and there were many,many,many really good ideas, such as: Don't post images that you’d regret posting in 20 years time (when Google rule the planet), If your parents saw this image/video would they think that it’s okay that you are posting it and lastly, don’t post hurtful or mean pictures to anyone.
