    <td>I finished my work on pyg latin and started working on functions, mainly parameters and arguments. An argument is what you put in the bracket when defining a function, and is what you use to tell the computer what it should return based on what is typed in. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure not to rush and be decisive when I am typing in the code, for example I forget that I have to put the colons on the end of 'if', ‘elif’ and ‘else’ statements. I also usually forget that I have to indent the text after and ‘if’, ‘elif’ or ‘else’ statement, if I want the code to be read correctly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure to go slow and specifically look out for when and where I put colons, double checking just so that I won’t constantly get an error message and make sure to indent my code so it doesn’t have to say: error: Expected indented block.</td>
