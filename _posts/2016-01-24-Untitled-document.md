**IT HOMEWORK**

**	**In our IT lesson this week we looked at how people alter or edit various things to make them look more pleasing, for instance we watched a video about how -at McDonald's and other restaurants - they make a completely new burger, which takes a few HOURS(!), they then take a picture of the burger and edit it to make it look even more delicious and flawless. The 'moral' of this video, well at least for our lesson, was that on things like social media and other things, people can be untruthful and lie to you, and can act differently to you when they’re on social media. We then went on to do a little activity, which I guess was a little bit of a social experiment, but anyway… What happened was the two sides of the room were agree and disagree ( right side disagree, left side agree), Mr.Keen then read out some statements, which we either: agreed, disagreed or weren’t sure or were neutral about the statement. When we came back in Mr.Keen asked us all, whether or not we changed where we stood in the classroom because of where our friends stood, and a surprisingly large amount of people put their hand up. This connects to my previous point about how people act differently based on who they are with. This class discussion then lead on to Mr.Keen asking what we thought some rules should be when we were using social media, here are a few examples:  Don’t try to be mean to people, don’t post inappropriate or personal pictures, don’t give away personal information and don’t retaliate to people bullying you.

	Those were only a few of the rules, and I'm not sure if I could list them all.
