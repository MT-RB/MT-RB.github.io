             **       Blog Post**

In this week's lesson - not only did we receive the physical micro:bit - we did more of a PSHE type of lesson, on what we were afraid of / didn’t want to see on the internet and what it was used for. There were multiple other points, but the few main points that came up were:

-Grooming

-Sexting

-Pornographic content

We then went more in-depth about what we have seen on the internet, with Mr.Keen asking us various questions about whether or not we had seen anything pornographic or inappropriate, either by accident or on purpose. He also asked us about the definition of a paedophile, which (if you don't know) is an adult that is sexually attracted to a child.

We ended the lesson by being asked (as homework) to look at some news articles on the topics of 'revenge porn' and ‘sexting’, which I have added links to here…

'Revenge Porn':[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/29596583](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/29596583)

And
