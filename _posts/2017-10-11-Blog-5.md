    <td>I asked my peers for help and worked alongside them. I put in extra effort just to make sure that I had all of the previous work functioning properly before I started. By doing this it meant that I would always know that it was a problem with my new code opposed to it being earlier work. <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQcRUgnIklWdhby40KYpwXlmkuT5a53Sowp426nMZWKRUboNXDIu7AV3_ysKYse0FRrTc8x2sKuN71m/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe></td>

    <td>I need to work on being more precise and accurate. This includes making sure that I have all brackets, colons, commas, semicolons, etc in the correct places as well as checking that there aren't any typos or me just being straight up stupid, and doing something like using the wrong range.</td>

    <td>I will work on my precision and continue to work with and help the people around me with the work. I will also make sure that I have definitely got everything from the previous weeks working from now on.</td>
