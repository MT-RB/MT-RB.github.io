    <td>I learnt by listening to Mr.Keen and just doing basic things, such as making sure to watch what he did very carefully. I then just worked through logically and if I forgot how to do something I would either look it up or just have a little search around to see if I could find it myself. I also asked my peers for help at times.</td>

    <td>I will focus more in the work and exactly what I have to do to complete it before I even attempt to make anything look better or ask my peers if they need help, as well as continuing to do what I already am to make sure that I work as effectively as possible.</td>
