    <td>I started to learn about the 'String Theory', which is pretty much learning about string variables. I also learnt how to organise or format a code in such a way that it is easier to read, by alternating the text colour for different sections and differentiating between variables and normal code, by starting all variable words with a capital letter.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limits my learning was that our HDMI cable was faulty, meaning that we spent a significant amount of time trying to fix it , and when it was finally fixed, even nudging the FUZE box slightly would give you a black screen, leading to you having to have to wiggle the cable around until it was just right.</td>

    <td>Next time I will work on taking more time on making sure that all of my station is correctly set up and that all of my coding is neat and precise.</td>
